> for those of us who have IPv4 addresses today, there really isn't much of a problem in the short term. It's just that there won't be any addresses for new users a few years from now.

This is from today's Ars Technica article on the [IPV4 to IPV6 transition](http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2010/09/there-is-no-plan-b-why-the-ipv4-to-ipv6-transition-will-be-ugly.ars). This is here and this is now. India NEEDS to move to IPV6 as fast as possible to avoid being roadblocked in the information economy.

China is already well on its way with CNGI - [China Next Generation Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Next_Generation_Internet).

> ... With the implementation of IPv6, China plans to avoid imminent problems ofÂ [IPv4 address exhaustion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion "IPv4 address exhaustion").

This is not a Ministry of Telecommunications issue - this is a Human Resources Development issue.
