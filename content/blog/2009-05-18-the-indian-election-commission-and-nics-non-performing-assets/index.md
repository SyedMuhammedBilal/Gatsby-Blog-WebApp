This post is inspired by this posting on [YCombinator](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=615138), widely panning the election commission's deplorable IT infrastructure.

I can understand non-familiarity with backend infrastructure design, but why is the website interface so, so bad. This is an even bigger case for doing the design for a website out in public, similar to how [ConceptShare](http://www.conceptshare.com/) works.

There are an incredible number of grid based CSS [frameworks](http://www.w3avenue.com/2009/04/29/definitive-list-of-css-frameworks-pick-your-style/) and [javascript frameworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_frameworks) which simplifies readable website development. And using these frameworks are completely independent of which server-side frameworks you use - Java, ASPX, .Net, etc.and is actually much simpler to use(as part of the aforementioned frameworks ) than the server side code itself.

CSS and Javascript are simply used within the web-page itself and are used by the browser of the user to display/render the page more effectively. In fact there is a recent CSS framework to improve [web-readability](http://code.google.com/p/better-web-readability-project/).

I really hope the National Informatics Centre starts cleaning up its website interface - as it stands it is a huge wastage of time and effort and frankly a drain of taxpayer money
