it seems that many SSTP VPN providers (like UnblockVPN) screw with port 6667. Freenode being unusually paranoid about Tor/VPN users doesnt let these users to connect.

I have found that using port 7070 with SSL works brilliantly. I'm not sure whether it will work for other IRC servers, but Freenode is what is relevant for me anyways.
