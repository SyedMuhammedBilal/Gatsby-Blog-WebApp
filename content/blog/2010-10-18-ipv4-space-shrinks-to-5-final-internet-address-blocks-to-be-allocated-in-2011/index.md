[This](http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/18/ipv4/) is really alarming - it means that our entire internet (both desktop and mobile/3G) growth is going to depend on some clever internet address acrobatics, through our ISPs.

India NEEDS to move completely to IPV6 now. I am not sure why the government is not deeply concerned by this.
