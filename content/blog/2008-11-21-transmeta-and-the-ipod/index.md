What does Transmeta and the Ipod have in common?

Well, that question was posed by this [post](http://jab-semi.blogspot.com/2008/11/two-strategies-you-dont-want-in-your.html) and its [comments](http://jab-semi.blogspot.com/2008/11/two-strategies-you-dont-want-in-your.html#2043394122732354135) .The question was, did Transmeta never have a foot to stand on in the first place?

I dont think so.

Take a look at this [article](http://tinyurl.com/5v6kdw).

What we have here is a prediction that 30% of all non-desktop IT infrastructure will be virtualized. Hell, I use virtualization at home and I'd do it on my desktops as well - that way I can future proof my working environment across hardware failures and obsolescence.

But, one of the big problems with virtualization is the "_Ipod/Itunes Syndrome_" (my own definition!). You buy into iPod, you buy through iTunes and now you are non-portable. Even though it is called "music wherever you go". You virtualize on X86 and suddenly, you have troubles migrating **_live_** VMs across architectures. And you cannot shut VMs down - they run websites you know.

Transmeta had virtualization at the hardware level right from the beginning (Code Morphing). That could have been a compelling offering if it had been sold properly. _Code Morphing_ has been widely panned because it had originally claimed native X86 like performance, which did not actually happen. But when you virtualize, you are _aware_ that you will sacrifice some performance.

Why has the Mac suddenly become such a compelling work environment - because of [Parallels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels_Desktop_for_Mac) . You want to develop on Linux, just create a VM - you want to play World of Warcraft on Windows, you got a VM. But the biggest problem is there is'nt a viable MacOSX VM to develop in ([Leo4VMWare](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.insanelymac.com%2Flofiversion%2Findex.php%2Ft96277-300.html&ei=x5MmScLKBdK1kAW49rzyBw&usg=AFQjCNGQWMTRu8jLZ4KNp6zek1ThaqFsLA&sig2=hGR-ZF_uTleUQtXKDRSSiQ) non-withstanding). Could Transmeta, potentially have made a viable solution? Probably.

Why do I think so - because of this [breakthrough](http://www.itnews.com.au/News/88463,redhat-and-amd-migrate-vms-across-cpus.aspx). The technological grounding behind this would be the basis of an advanced virtualization technology - something that Transmeta could have done.
