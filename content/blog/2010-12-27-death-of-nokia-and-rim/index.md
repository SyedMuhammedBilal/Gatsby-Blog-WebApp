I was reading this [editorial](http://www.asymco.com/2010/12/27/the-85-smartphone/) about a new Broadcom chip - the BCM2157. Let's see what we have here:

- Dual core
- top speed of 800mhz
- Supports wifi hotspot
- Low power
- Android 2.2

The suggested MRP for a smartphone made using this chipset is $100 - not the cost price, but the cost after profit accounting.

This is huge - I just dont see how RIM or Nokia can top this. Hell... the iphone will have a hard time topping this, but you need to account for the _reality distortion field_.

The biggest growth in mobiles is gonna come from Asia - India and China being the two fastest growing mobile markets. This price point is spot on for these markets.
