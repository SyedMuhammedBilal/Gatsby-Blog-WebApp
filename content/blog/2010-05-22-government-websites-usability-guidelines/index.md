Awesome resource at [Usability.gov](http://www.usability.gov/index.html), which focuses specifically on usability [guidelines](http://www.usability.gov/guidelines/index.html) and [templates](http://www.usability.gov/templates/index.html) for building and designing government websites.

I think all our websites should adopt this - the government need only point the vendor to follow these guidelines
