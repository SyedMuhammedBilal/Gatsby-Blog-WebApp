I really believe I have close to an ideal zshrc - it addresses nearly all the concerns outlined in this [rant](http://markhansen.co.nz/fish-sucks), plus it also maintains compatibility with most of bash's keybindings and some ubuntu-specific magic (like missing command suggestions)

It is as close to a first timers' ideal .zshrc.  Get it here: [https://gist.github.com/752676]
