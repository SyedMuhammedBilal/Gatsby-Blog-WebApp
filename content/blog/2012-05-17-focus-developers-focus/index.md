Today, I saw this post about a [request](http://www.webupd8.org/2012/05/help-test-audience-media-player.html) to test the Audience media player in Linux. This is after the recent news that VLC has been downloaded [1 billion](http://www.theverge.com/apps/2012/5/15/3022571/vlc-celebrates-one-billion-downloads) times.

Explain to me again - why exactly do we need another media player, when there are so many projects left to be done.

For example, I will pay good money to see an awesome network manager implementation in Gnome-shell : one which will support VPN/wifi/3g/etc. natively, has support for blocklists, maintains traffic info for 3g, wifi, etc. (in case you havent noticed, unlimited plans are on their way out around the world).

This is what we need, not another twitter client - not another media player.
