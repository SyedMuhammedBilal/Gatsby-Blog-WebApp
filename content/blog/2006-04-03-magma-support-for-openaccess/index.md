This is not surprising, but tiresome. Magma [supports](http://www.eetimes.com/news/design/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=5BGFKARP4I13GQSNDBCCKHSCJUMEKJVN?articleID=184417561) the Si2 OpenAccess format for inter-operability. Now this would be a non-issue except for one thing - Magma apparently has cool internal data structures to support its entire unified flow. And what's more, these data structures are [patented](http://gauss.ffii.org/PatentView/EP1092201).

However, I suppose this makes sense from a business perspective. Magma is'nt used across the entire design cycle. The front-end is dominated by the Big Three. And I suppose when big design firms ask you to read data in formats dumped by other tools, you're gonna have to do it.
