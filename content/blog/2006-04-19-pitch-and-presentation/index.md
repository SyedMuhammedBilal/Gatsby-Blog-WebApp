Ashwin, over at [Venturewoods](http://www.venturewoods.org/), linked to a great [presentation](http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/). This is a presentation given at OSCON 2005 by Dick Hardt, CEO, Sxip Identity.

I think the most important thing is to have a flawless demo (if any) and an intensity that burns through - everything else is just language.

I mean look at the [Yoda Master](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjfRICAisB0) himself.
