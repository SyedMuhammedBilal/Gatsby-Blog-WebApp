just wanted to put it out there - the Dell Inspiron 14R (N4010) supports 6GB for sure ... and I wont be surprised for 8GB.

Surprisingly, one of the big reasons Dell mentions that we buy vostro is for the enhanced RAM support. This is pure FUD.

Go ahead and buy the 14R - we put in both Kingston and Corsair 4GB single-sticks. It worked beautifully.
