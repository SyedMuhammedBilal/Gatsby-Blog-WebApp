I just dont know - Ubuntu is sucking so much more that it is affecting my work severely. I have infact made an [offer](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/568711/comments/105) to buy Amazon gift coupons for fixes.

[Bug 568711](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/568711) is particularly nasty : it targets suspend and resume behavior. The worst part is that it is **_confirmed_ with a severity of medium** and is currently **unassigned**. What is this -throw laptop users under a bus day ? It is things like this that is making Windows 7 more and more attractive as an alternative OS.

[Bug 613628](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/613628) affects my ability to use multiple monitors which is absolutely the way I work these days. What is sad about this bug is that it affects the chipsets with a fully  open source driver  (intel graphics) and these are the ones that are most popular on laptops. Just take a look at the [workarounds](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/Lucidi8xxFreezes) for the intel graphics drivers - there are 6 workarounds.

I simply cannot wait for the [Wayland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server)) graphics stack and end this crap once and for all.
