Over the past couple of days, I have been reading about decreasing eye strain by using better programming fonts and colors.

So, to help me with Visual Studio, I chose this [style](http://www.iunknown.com/2007/06/vibrant_ink_vis.html), which is visually quite similar to the Inkpot color scheme for my favorite editor (Vim) (BTW, here is a [page full of comparisons](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maverick/VimColorSchemeTest/) for 256 color schemes for Vim - make sure you set **_set t\_Co=256_** ).

Then, after looking for some fonts (going through this [discussion](http://www.donationcoder.com/Forums/bb/index.php?PHPSESSID=cs7qd5937mmtsqn6nmdsr6oci5&topic=2499.25) on 18pt programming fonts) I saw this - [Profont](http://www.tobias-jung.de/seekingprofont/), with a long story on why it is a good programming font.

So, Im using it for the time being, with the search being constantly on to find better fonts. There is a nice little [article by Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/06/12.html?hi=joel) on the difference in font-rendering philosophies between Apple and Microsoft (I had [covered a key patent](http://sandeep.wordpress.com/2008/01/03/a-tale-of-freetype-and-apple/) that Freetype on Linux had disabled by default).

P.S. for those in the Linux world, who want to use these fonts with Vim/Emacs, here's a nice [article](http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/installing-fonts-linux) on how to install fonts (with and without administrator priveleges). Use the **_~/.fonts_** folder.
