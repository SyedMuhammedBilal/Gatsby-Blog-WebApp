One of the most intriguing, and exciting posts I read was a 2002 [Wired](http://www.wired.com) magazine [story](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.07/Nvidia.html) about nVidia CEO -Jen Hsun Huang- planning to make nVidia , a contender for Intel's pie. This year, NVidia has been on a roll, since its 6800 core GPU's outperformed ATI's x800 cores in Doom3 benchmarks (ATI does perform better on Half-Life, but that is due to ATI's 24 bit shaders which are used heavily by HL2 compared to nVidia's 8,16,32 bit shaders).

Today's [story](http://www.eetimes.com/in_focus/silicon_engineering/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=OTHVODXWTYO0KQSNDBGCKH0CJUMEKJVN?articleID=55300880&_requestid=475236) in EETimes adds a small footnote to those plans. However, with news of nVidia's [cross-licencing pact](http://www.pcauthority.com.au/news.aspx?CIaNID=17058) with Intel, I wonder if it is hedging its bets.
