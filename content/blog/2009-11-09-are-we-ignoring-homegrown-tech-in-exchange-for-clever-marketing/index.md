Today's Mint newspaper carried an [article](http://www.livemint.com/2009/11/08203913/Bell-Labs-looks-to-move-into-s.html) about the development plans of Bell Labs in India.

Bell Labs, as an institution, is something that I respect greatly - it was personally responsible for UNIX, the transistor, the laser and other game changing inventions. Yet when I read about VillageNET - I was very underwhelmed. (Note: unfortunately, you will have to be a paid member to read anything about [VillageNET](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1286569))

> The lab has developed a low-cost wireless-mesh architecture that extends from a town over multiple hops to bring a broadband pipe to rural areas. The lab says it has managed to extend the wi-fi range by using “directional” antenna, commoditized wi-fi radios and novel software that minimizes interference and maximizes system performance.Calling it VillageNet, the lab is close to signing a memorandum of understanding with a Union government agency to start rolling it in rural areas, says Poosala. He is not willing to disclose the name of the agency.

Why do I feel this way?  **AirJaldi**

I have previously written about [AirJaldi](http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/airjaldi-cost-and-terrain-effective-wireless-solution-for-rural-communities/) - the low cost, innovative wireless network **already implemented and in use** at Dharamsala. It already enables thousands of computers ([2000 of them in 2007](http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/56)) working over [45 KM](http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/106) radius using the Dharamsala Community Wireless Mesh Network.

All this technology is free. There are no MoUs, no agreements, no revenue sharing.

It is mutually beneficial - since if the government deploys the AirJaldi Mesh technology on a larger scale, the technology gets fine tuned such that the original creators are benefited.

Note that I do not believe that vested interests are at play here - it is ignorance. The governmental body that makes all the decisions, can be easily reached by well-intentioned corporate bodies through good PR/Marketing.

I just wish that the government pays attention to a group of brilliant scientists - who have created a living, breathing technology which is actually delivering benefit of ten of thousands of people.
