[This](http://msftkitchen.com/2010/06/windows-8-plans-leaked-numerous-details-revealed.html) was a very interesting leak by someone at Microsoft about Windows 8.

I see package management, fast boot up, power efficiency, diagnostic power tools... in short everything that linux has touted as its USP.

Unless there is a big push from the Redhat/Ubuntu camps to improve drivers, usability and multimedia support - I see a bipolar future : OSX and Windows 8
