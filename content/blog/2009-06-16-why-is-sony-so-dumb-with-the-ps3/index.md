An unbelievable article came out today - Ghostbusters on the [PS3 vs 360](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/06/ghostbusters-graphically-youll-want-to-stick-with-the-360.ars) - note that PS3 has 8 coresÂ  and is more powerful on paper. But then we have opinions like this where some "suit" at Sony says that they actually want to [make it difficult](http://games.slashdot.org/games/09/03/01/1522259.shtml) for developers to make games for the PS3. The compilers that the PS3 uses took a long, long time to stabilise, vs the 360.

On the other hand, see what Apple did - it had to convince developers (and by developers I mean Micosoft's Office on Mac and Adobe's Photoshop Mac groups) to develop on transitioning hardware : from the PowerPC to Intel 32 bit to Intel 64 bit. They leveraged the power of the [LLVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Level_Virtual_Machine) open source compiler architecture (which has now emerged as a competing, easier licensed, [less obfuscated](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1168313&seqNum=2) version of gcc). They made it easier for the compiler developers to create better compilers.

I own a PS3 and feel it is a really complete system - with user changeable HDDs, Linux supported, etc. but the management is really insane if it keeps on pulling such crap. Why would I want to buy a more expensive console which performs worse? And with [Project Natal,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Natal) Microsoft has gone to the next level with the 360.

Atleast they can open up PS2 backward compatibility for God's sake - [Shadow of the Colossus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus) alone would be worth it.
