Oh it hurts so much ... in India, we have been living under the looming spectre of oil prices. And right now, when Im staggering bewildered asto how it came to pass and trying unsuccessfully to supress my anguish at them oil kings, I came across this [post](http://www.johannhari.com/index.php) which puts it all into some kind of perspective.

I follow [advances](http://sandeep.wordpress.com/2008/03/23/and-then-there-was-light/) in energy science with a keen interest and it seems to me that Johann has hit it right. Now is the time when you change all the bulbs in your house to CFL's, switch off your idle TVs and for god's sake get your [Mad Max-ian](http://www.madmaxmovies.com/cars/madmax/index.html) car serviced.

Speaking of energy and the environment, how cool was it about that kid [discovering](http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/297045780/article.pl) a plastic eating microbe. Someone write up a business plan and make that boy rich - he freaking deserves it.
