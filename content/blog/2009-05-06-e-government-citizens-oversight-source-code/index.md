The Sunlight Foundation's [Apps for America](http://sunlightlabs.com/appsforamerica/apps/) contest was a very cool thing - I especially liked [Filibusted](http://filibusted.us/) - the ability to track politicians who block policies in the house is invaluable.

However, this is not primarily what I am interested in - I would love learning how to architect [GovTrack](http://www.govtrack.us/), which is what enables ALL these websites and applications.

Architecting data on the government's side is the hard part - creating mashups at home is the easy part.
