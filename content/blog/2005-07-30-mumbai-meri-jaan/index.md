[![](images/amul22.gif)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2990/63/1600/amul22.gif) I love my Mumbai and the people. They came and they [fought back](http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/jul/29mt1.htm) and they helped other people. I spent four years in IIT-Bombay, but even after living away I realised, you can never take the Mumbai out of a man.
