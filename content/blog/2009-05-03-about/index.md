The one difference between governance and democratic reform in several first world countries and India is **data.** A very smart comment on an entrepreneurship blog once remarked – _measure everything and thus steer any discussion_. Nobody, repeat **nobody** has a hope in hell of taking one step towards democratic reform till you engineer the government to be more free flowing – in terms of information, processes, statistics, identification.

A digital government is the foundation on which reform can take place.

The job of this blog is very specific – I intend to propose and define architecture and processes which unblocks some of the kinks in the flow of governance information. It is not my job to comment upon policies – I hope and want to enable someone else to be able to do that, enabled by my digital government.
