The latest and greatest Ubuntu release Jaunty Jackalope is [here](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2009-April/000122.html). I prefer mine in the [KDE](http://torrent.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/simple/jaunty/desktop/kubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent) flavor, with the [Skulpture](http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php/Skulpture?content=59031) theme, the excellent [Droid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_%28font%29) fonts and [switching](http://www.spodesabode.com/discussion/51/making-ubuntu-look-better/) on [autohinting](http://sandeep.wordpress.com/2008/01/03/a-tale-of-freetype-and-apple/).

In case of using KDE, also remember to install the "_gtk-qt-engine_" for better looking Firefox.

For first timers, I would suggest the [Gnome](http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/9.04/ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent) flavor. It comes with all OpenOffice program, Firefox and everything else you would need.

Free your mind. Check out the Linux [advertorial](http://video.linuxfoundation.org/video/1106).
