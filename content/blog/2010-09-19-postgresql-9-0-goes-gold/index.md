Postgresql 9.0 has been [released](www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=ODYyMg) .

With built in [streaming replication](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Streaming_Replication) and [hot standby](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Hot_Standby),  it means there is absolutely no reason to go MySQL anymore.

Oh and if you want to use a PHP based CMS with Postgresql, use Drupal which has the best support.
