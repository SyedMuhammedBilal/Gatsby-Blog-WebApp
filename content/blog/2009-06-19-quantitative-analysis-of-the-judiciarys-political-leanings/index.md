I did not even know such a thing was possible, however there is a measure called the [Martin-Quinn](http://mqscores.wustl.edu/) measure, which quantifies the idealogical and political leanings of the United States Supreme Court justices .. based solely on their judgements.

The data comes off the [United States Supreme Court database](http://www.cas.sc.edu/poli/juri/), and has been plotted as a quasi heat-map at [ScotusScores](http://scotusscores.com/) - they have even published their [source code](hi,    financial constraints et al (downturn.. downturn), forced me to turn creative when i had to direly upgrade my 60GB laptop hard disk.  I opened up my WD Passport Portable (yes.. there is a way, check out Youtube) and took out my 160GB WD1600BEVS and used in my laptop and then plugged back the 60GB to be used as a portable drive.  Has anyone else done something like this ?   I hope there is no difference between the hard disks used in portable drives and those used in laptops..).

This looks to be a very interesting way in which to quantitatively analyze the judges and their judgements. If one could add some sort of regression analysis, then anomalies in judgements (which could mean nepotism) could be detected.
