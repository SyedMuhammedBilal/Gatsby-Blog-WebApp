title: "Why the PS4 is going to be dead in the water"

The PS4 was just announced - without an actual console or pricing. But that's not the worst part - the worst part, the part that is going to kill it is this: no backwards compatibility with PS3 games except through streaming.

The PS4 just signed its own death warrant - there is no way every house in the PS3's demographic is wired for that kind of bandwidth. Especially in Asia.

I dont even understand why the Sony execs would take a step like this - Especially with the Steam box/"_**Piston**_" and the **SHIELD** [device](http://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2013/01/15/why-steambox-and-shield-may-cause-the-death-of-consoles-as-we-know-them/), the console makers are already threatened.

And now they eliminate the single biggest reason to stick with the Playstation platform - sunken costs of game titles.

I personally cant wait for Valve's Piston - especially if it is going to be Android based.
