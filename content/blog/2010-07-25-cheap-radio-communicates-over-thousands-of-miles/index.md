[This](http://www.nycresistor.com/2010/06/26/crossing-the-pond-with-100-milliwatts/) is incredible - it is a cheap radio transmitter that is usable over thousands of miles. I can think of innumerable circumstances in India where such cheap technology could be invaluable.

Right from delivery of education, weather alerts to aiding security forces in dense jungles, there are a million possibilities.
