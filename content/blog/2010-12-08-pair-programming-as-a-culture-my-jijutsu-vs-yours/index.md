At Clearsenses, I enforce pair programming as a loose practice for all the verticals that I lead. I saw this recent [article](http://blog.tridgell.net/?p=111) about the lead programmers of the Samba project talking about how effective pair programming is for them. And of course, a whole bunch of [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ehqvx/samba_lead_despite_only_one_of_us_typing_at_a/) comments dissing them.

#### The nature of the programmer

I think all programmers walk with a huge ego around them - and I think that is a good thing. People who think of their code as their jijutsu are some ofot t the most interesting people to learn from. But that ego goes with a fear of not being good enough - the classic adage of  "_no matter how fast you are or how strong you are, there is always someone faster or stronger"_.

And that affects productivity.

It affects the way you think about problems, about code and about practices. Not that you should not have an opinion (and a strong one at that). But why not open yourself up to the opportunity that your opinion is wrong ?

Its pretty much like asking a pretty girl out for a date - you are the pretty girl ;)  If you are convinced that no guy in dis town is interesting enough, you give up the opportunity to be seduced.

And all code is, of course, poetry.
