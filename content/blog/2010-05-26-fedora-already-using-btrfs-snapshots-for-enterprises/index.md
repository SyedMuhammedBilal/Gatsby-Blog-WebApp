Oh boy - I just saw [this](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/SystemRollbackWithBtrfs). While I still [dont believe](http://sandeep.wordpress.com/2009/12/05/a-cheap-reliable-fileserver-with-features-similar-to-commercial-offerings/) that BTRFS is just as good as ZFS (despite Linux kernel developers saying [different](http://blogs.sun.com/bonwick/entry/rampant_layering_violation)), Fedora is being leagues ahead of Ubuntu here.

What it means is for every package install, the OS snapshots your volumes and you can rollback in case of a problem.

Nifty!
