Following an [initiative](http://www.technologyreview.com/web/23096/) by the Sunlight Labs in the US, I think we have a great opportunity to combine Right-To-Information, volunteers and Web 2.0 technologies to make the government much more transparent.

The initiative is part of a project by the [U.S Transparency Corps](http://www.transparencycorps.org/), a non-governmental watchdog organisation, to create a technological platform to enable thousands of volunteers to manually analyze PDF scans of paper documents, and file the governmental grants in a searchable database. This helps bring under public scrutiny, a large part of fund allocation which frequently comes under discretionary authority and therefore does not have to be reported.

In India, a large problem with Right-To-Information is that information is not available. This is because, deliberately or otherwise, a lot of intra-governmental workflows happen over paper with no electronic trails. This makes the RTI largely ineffectual.

An architecture to get volunteers to convert paper-scan data into electronic form has to be very carefully designed - to take care of the malicious aspect of people trying to put incorrect values, for kicks or for personal benefit. Technologies like [reCAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA) have figured out how to account for trust in people and that can be capitalized upon here.

Combined, all these technologies have the potential to take the Right-to-Information to new heights of govt. transparency.
