This is a company started by one of my batchmates at IIT Bombay - Gaurang Kanvinde. Proaxys Software has technology to convert ordinary XML feeds to mp3 - which they embed in a feed of their own.

So basically, they do **auto-podcasting** or **podcastify** their feed.

Take a hear at three partial feeds that I podcastified from [Robert Scoble](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/)'s website (my apologies).

For example http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/04/07/net-bcl-team-blogging/ is mapped to http://www.proaxsysreader.com/data/rss/2/1144521572771.mp3 . I liked the way their software recognizes ".NET" to be pronounced as "dot-Net"

Even more interesting is http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/04/07/daily-kos-crashes-microsofts-gate/ mapped to http://www.proaxsysreader.com/data/rss/2/1144521574796.mp3. It can pronounce "Tamara Pesik" and "Markos Moulitsas Zuniga". That has got to count for something!!!

To try it out yourself -

1\. go to http://www.proaxsysreader.com/rss.jsp

2\. Enter the feed url and your email address

3\. Check your email to get the auto-generated passord

4\. Go to http://www.proaxsysreader.com/myreader/index.jsp

5\. sign in

6\. Click on "my feeds" and listen (using a podcast compatible software)

EDIT: Gaurang has mailed and said that the link generation process for your feed has been greatly simplified - sounds quite cool too!! **Technorati Tags: [proaxys](http://technorati.com/tag/proaxys) [scoble](http://technorati.com/tag/scoble) [podcasting](http://technorati.com/tag/podcasting)**
