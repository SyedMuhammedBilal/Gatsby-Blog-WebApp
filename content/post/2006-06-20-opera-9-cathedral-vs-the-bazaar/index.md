Today, I - a staunch open-source fan, tasted blood when I tried out [Opera 9](http://www.opera.com/). First of all, its the only browser to pass the [Acid2 test](http://webstandards.org/action/acid2/), has its own integrated BitTorrent client and ... its [little brother](http://mini.opera.com/) works great on my mobile phone!

It is truly surprising that a small group of not-too-highly-paid, but brilliant programmers created software to outdo a collaborative effort (Firefox).

Seems to me as one example where the [Cathedral won over the Bazaar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar).
