Note that I asked **when** rather than **can.**

As Kiran is wont to wink and whisper conspiratorially "_wait before you buy a phone -Â the duals and quads will be out soon_ ". And then I see this [article](http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/15/nvidia-announces-quad-core-kal-el-soc-promises-it-in-tablets-by/):

> A 2560 x 1440 stream was being decoded on a developmental device, scaled down to that slate's native 1366 x 768 resolution, and additionally displayed on a connected 30-inch, 2560 x 1600 monitor. That entire voluminous workload was being handled in real time by Kal-El and we saw no signs of it struggling.

Forget about all the fucking dual monitor madness - this is not where the market is.

Give me [Crysis 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crysis_2) on my Tegra phone which I can connect to my monitor and play at 1080P. Do you have any idea how much that shit will sell ? I would gladly pay upto a thousand dollars (with the shitty exchange rate) for that. Hell, I'll pay that much for a 720P capability.

Am rooting for you nVidia - heaven knows you need it. I cant throw a stone without hitting an AMD/ATI setup.
