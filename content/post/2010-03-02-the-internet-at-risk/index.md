The director of the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration has [indicated](http://dns.tmcnet.com/topics/internet-security/articles/77181-ntias-strickling-we-need-internet-policy-30.htm) the U.S. government would want more control into the working of the internet. Considering the main directory of internet addresses is [ICANN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN), it is not very difficult for them.

One of the most interesting comments:

> f foreign governments do not trust the Internet governance systems, they will threaten to balkanize the Domain Name System which will jeopardize the worldwide reach of the Internet.

But the internet is architected around balkanization - it is meant to be self-healing. And in case someone tries to stop you from information you are meant to access, there are ways to get around it **as long as the main internet is still willing and present.** However, what I am afraid of is **Internet Blockades**, where a particular country is knocked off the worldwide internet, based on foreign policy.
