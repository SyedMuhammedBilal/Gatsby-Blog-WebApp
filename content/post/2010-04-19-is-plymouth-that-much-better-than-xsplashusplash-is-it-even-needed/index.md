I hate Plymouth - I hate it with a vengeance that I did not know I had. Ubuntu 10.04 has had one of the worst overall experiences since... oh I dont know Redhat 6.1 ????? Ubuntu KMS (kernel mode setting) has some of the worst incompatibilities with nVidia chipsets.

I have no doubt that eventually they will figure it out - but was it ever justified to spend SO MUCH time for something that I see once in a month or so (I rebooted my Ubuntu 9.10 laptop maybe once a month or so) ?

Now, installation has issues .. suspend/resume doesnt work.- but all godawful time is spent in Plymouth and KMS issues.

And still people have to jump through a million hoops to get webcams to work with Skype.

Yesterday, I had to boot into Win7 to play my copy of S.T.A.L.K.E.R ... and man does Win7 look wonderful. KDE sucks balls so hard : the popups and the callouts have thick borders and wasted space. But the biggest problem is that Win7 (and OSX) are resolution independent - they look great on whichever monitor.

KDE (and Gnome to a lesser extent) look horrible in any monitor.

Guys, just forget about Plymouth and KMS and all that crap and please work at getting webcam and low-latency sound (Jackd?) to work, so I can get more developers to port games to Linux
