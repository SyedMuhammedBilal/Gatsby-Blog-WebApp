The incredible [OpenBTS](http://openbts.sourceforge.net/) project (about which I have previously [written](http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2010/01/18/dirt-cheap-gsm-mobile-telephony-for-developing-countries/)) has now been extensively field tested in various scenarios. This project (founded by [Harvind Samra](http://www.linkedin.com/in/harvindsamra)) uses opensource and linux technologies to create a license-free cellular network.

One such field test was at the Burning Man festival in 2009 and there are extensive [field reports](http://openbts.sourceforge.net/FieldTest2/index.html) available. The May/June 2010 edition of MIT Technology Review has picked up OpenBTS and included a [small primer](http://www.technologyreview.com/communications/25107/?a=f) on it.

The HRD ministry needs to pick and fund such projects, maybe as part of govt-funded engineering projects in final year courses.
