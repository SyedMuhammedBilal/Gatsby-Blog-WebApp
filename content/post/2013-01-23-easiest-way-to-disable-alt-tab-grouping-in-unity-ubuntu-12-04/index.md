title: "Easiest way to disable alt-tab grouping in Unity (Ubuntu 12.04)"

The Unity shell enables grouping of windows in alt-tab. This is seriously irritating and counterproductive to a lot of us.

I see constant questions on how to disable this and most of it involved installing some tool and checking/unchecking boxes in sequence.

Well, this is an automated script to enable the same - you can even use this if you are doing automated deployment.
