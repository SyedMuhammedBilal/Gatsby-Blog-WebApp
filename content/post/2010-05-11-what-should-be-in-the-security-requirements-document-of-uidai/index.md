This - [OIX US ICAM LOA 1 Trust Framework](/sites/default/files/oix-us-icam-loa1-tfp-assessment-package-2010-02-12.pdf ) (esp page 19 onwards) - should be what the security and privacy requirements document be modelled on. Designed by several of the top security and privacy researchers for the U.S Govt's [Open Identity Framework](http://openidentityexchange.org/creating-a-new-trust-framework) (which I dont know, why we are not making use of - its open and free to use)

Everything else is just a knee-jerk reaction.
