Now they have done it - when the demigod [John Carmack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Carmack) is able to push out [Rage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(video_game)) at a higher FPS on the Xbox 360 **and the lowly PC,** [than the PS3](http://computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=220530) (with its nVidia RSX chip), you know that they are on their gaming deathbed.

I have written about this [before](http://sandeep.wordpress.com/2009/06/17/why-is-sony-so-dumb-with-the-ps3/), and I still cant believe Sony wants to keep its higher-priced console on the same collision course. I still believe the PS3 is a great machine - however with its crippled tools and developer initiatives, it is seriously hindering its own growth.

For a long time now, PS3 has been unable to play PS2 games (and so I have never been able to play [Shadow of the Colossus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus)). Only recently, have they even got around to _**[patenting](http://www.engadget.com/2009/06/30/sony-patents-new-cell-based-ps2-emulator/)**_ emulating the PS2's Emotion Engine processor on the PS3. This means they still have to get around emulating the PS2 GPU.

What makes this hard to swallow is projects like [PCSX2](http://www.pcsx2.net/), which fully emulates the PS2 on the PC - and all this was done by enthusiasts without access to the source code. I mean just check out their SoTC emulated [gameplay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FzhSpziaps).

Sony needs to get its act together, or be prepared for [Betamax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax) v 2.0.
