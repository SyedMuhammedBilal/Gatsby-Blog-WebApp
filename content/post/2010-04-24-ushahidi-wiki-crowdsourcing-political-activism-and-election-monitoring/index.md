This is something truly innovative - [Ushahidi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushahidi) is a free and open source wiki software which has been used for such diverse use cases like the [Haiti Earthquake](http://haiti.ushahidi.com/reports/submit), [Kenya election violence crisis](http://legacy.ushahidi.com/) , [Sudan elections](http://www.sudanvotemonitor.com/) .. and even [Afghanistan's event reports](http://aliveinafghanistan.org/).

I truly believe such free and field-tested tools should be the ones deployed in our government, rather than some hastily put together [election commission webpage](http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/faq/Elecroll.asp).
