[ACH](http://competinghypotheses.org/) \- Analysis of Competing Hypotheses, is a research tool originally developed for the U.S. Intelligence Community. In a Wired.com [article](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/08/cia-software-developer-goes-open-source-instead/) it was reported that the author, frustrated with his attempts to get the U.S. Govt to use a superior software, gave up and open sourced it instead.

That is happening today. I'm going to give it a spin, just to check out what could be leveraged by intelligence communities worldwide to build a collaborative intelligence sharing system.
