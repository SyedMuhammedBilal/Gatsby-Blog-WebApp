Brad Feld, VC extraordinaire, has this excellent [post](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/001710.html) about the compensation that early stage advisors should get. What is more interesting is that Brad actually talks numbers!!!

For example, 1% vested over four years is in the top range of the compensation bracket. What Brad usually [prefers](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/000339.html) is 0.25% <=x <=1%.  

However, one of the more interesting aspects of this is trigger acceleration of vesting. 

'Tis very simple actually; I put my blood 'n sweat in the Company; Company gets acquired; I get screwed out of my options.

The alternative is to have a clause that says - In the event of a M&A only (single trigger event), or else a M& followed by me getting fired (double trigger event), I will get automatic acceleration of n on my vesting.

The other interesting aspects coming out of his incomparable [term sheet series](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/term_sheet/index.html) , is that it could be more advantageous to have a vesting period of one year and re-visit the relatioship after that as well as no-cash-compensation.

Cool. Now about that company....
