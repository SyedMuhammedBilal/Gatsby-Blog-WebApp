The answer - NO.

This post is basically out of a comment I posted on Hacker News.

Blackberrys are killer on **_messaging_** not **_apps_**. The answer to the Blackberry question is more server-side than client-side.Here in India, I see most of the hip young crowd carrying Blackberrys. Note that unlocked, grey-market iPhones are available in India at not-too-deterring prices. But Blackberrys are defacto, and all you see people doing is message, message, message.

We have some of the rock bottom rates on calls and SMS - yet you can buy a fixed-rate Blackberry messenger subscription at nearly every service provider in India which lets you do unlimited group messaging (irrespective of domestic or international). I _think_ you can also group-message a certain number of multimedia items.

Now that is something that not even Apple has cracked. The system is seamless.

## Prediction for the consumer market

The only competition to Blackberry in the hip-messaging market will come with the Facebook phone which will seamlessly integrate the mobile angle to the Facebook Messaging platform.

## Prediction for the enterprise market

R.I.M can only be broken by the final integration of Google Voice, Gizmo5, Slide/Disco and some form of video chat into Android. The notification-bar on Android is simply custom built for messaging notifications.
