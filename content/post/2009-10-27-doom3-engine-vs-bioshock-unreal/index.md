I had picked up a 5$ copy of yesteryears' best game - [Bioshock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock) - one which had the same bloodline as one of my all time fav games [System Shock 2.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_2)

Simultaneously, I had tried out a demo of Doom3 - a game which sadly I had never bought. I have a decently respectably Core2Duo 1.8G, 2.5G RAM, nVidia Go7400 card.

Doom ran spectacularly - at 1280 X 800 - my laptop's native resolution. I had a lot of graphics eyecandy turned on. Mouse movement was fluid. The story, of course, sucks - but Doom/Quake has never been about the story anyway. It's the experience.

Bioshock was how 20,000 leagues under the sea would have looked, done in a 1940's styling. The story and the plot was fabulous.

The engine, however, crawled. I used all the latest patches from Direct2Drive - but it still crawled. The Unreal engine has been no stranger to controversy regarding it's [quality](http://kotaku.com/gaming/busted/unreal-engine-3-half+baked-broken-and-late-280548.php) - however a lot of games still use it. As I was reading wikipedia about [ID Tech 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech_4) (as Doom3's engine is known), I found out that most game creators did not use it because of it's early lack of expansive views (a la [Farcry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry) ). However, ID soon released the [MegaTexture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatexture) technology.

The ID Tech 4 engine costs about [250,000$](http://www.idsoftware.com/business/idtech4/) - I am not sure if that is a factor. However, playing both the engines side by side, showed which one was more forgiving on older hardware.

Which means [Rage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(video_game)) (with [Virtual Texturing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatexture#Virtual_Texturing)) gets my vote - although I may end up buying it for my PS3.
