An amazing plugin for the Firefox browser - [Zotero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zotero). It lets you tag and save links - much more intuitively than bookmarking. It lets you actually save images, etc to the disk - in the form of a database. So you can back it up and restore it. It allows you tag based searching, etc.

Based on some semantic research technology , it automatically finds citations and saves it. A lot of applications like [SEASR](http://seasr.org/documentation/zotero/) can be downloaded and installed to data mine your saved zotero data.

Amazing for research work...
