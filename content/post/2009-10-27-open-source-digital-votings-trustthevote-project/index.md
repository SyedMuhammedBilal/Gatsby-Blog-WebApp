The [OSDV](http://osdv.org/about)'s, flagship project - [TrustTheVote](http://www.trustthevote.org/background) has been released to the common public amongst much [fanfare](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/10/open-source) - Hollywood and all participating. The goals of the project are very simple - trusted, auditable, secure voting systems.

the project plans, software downloads and hardware specs can be found [here](https://wiki.trustthevote.org/index.php/SHARP_Project#SHARP_Prototype). The source code version tracker is [here](http://github.com/trustthevote).

Given our status as the world's largest democracy, I'm really surprised we are'nt actively contributing to such projects.

Then again, I'm not surprised.
