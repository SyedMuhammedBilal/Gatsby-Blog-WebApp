[THIS](http://www.brightsideofnews.com/print/2009/10/12/an-inconvenient-truth-intel-larrabee-story-revealed.aspx) is one superbly researched, behind-the-scenes, whistle blower article. Wow. A window into the murky world of billion dollar CPU and graphics designs.

Personally, I am rooting for nVidia (thanks for the Linux support!). But, just last week I built a machine for virtualization - Quad X4 620, on a Gigabyte 785GS board with integrated ATI 4200 graphics. The price-to-power-to-power-consumption ration was just awesome.

AMD/ATI is in a nice position with their integrated chipsets - and the discrete ATI5870 is kicking ass.

But there is a new entry into the graphics arena - Imagination Technologies with the PowerVR core.

Nice.
