The very interesting thing about the Atrix is the dock - you put your phone into it and connect a myriad set of i/o devices (like a mouse, keyboard, LCD, etc.) and you get a working computer on your fingertips.

No, it isnt interesting by itself - there are a zillion devices out there with connectivity options - what is interesting is that the UI shift that happens when you connect a dock. It is no longer a UI that is governed by the touch/rotate/pinch interface, but by normal desktop point-n-click semantics. This is pretty awesome stuff if it is enabled across all the apps in Android. This is cool OS level stuff that is tantamount to your desktop changing from Gnome to KDE seamlessly when you connect something.

I cannot help but think of the implications of doing my programming on my phone and picking it up and leaving when I go home at the end of the day. The awesome graphics switching needs to be part of the Linux mainline - I would kill to have my Linux desktop work seamlessly using my HDMI port. Right now, I have trouble getting audio to work over HDMI to my TV.

Unsurprisingly, it is an nVidia Tegra chipset - nVidia is doing some pretty badass shit when it comes to mobile computing (unlike the Desktop market, where it is getting its behind reamed by ATI... and what of the upcoming AMD Llano ?)
