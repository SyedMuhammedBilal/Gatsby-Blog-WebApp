Just reposting a call for grassroot funding by the most exciting lisp-like project to come out in recent times - [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), especially since it is built over the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This enables businesses to leverage the gazillions of existing enteprise-scale Java libraries, and still use it in a lisp like syntax.

[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) (and [Lift](http://liftweb.net/)) and Clojure are two of the most exciting new developments happening in the programming-language theory world. Who knows, they may end up saving Java from [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) !

We are strongly considering using Scala and Lift to build our next webapp over Rails.

If only Java had a better package manager (like [gem](http://docs.rubygems.org/)) rather than that god-forsaken [maven](http://maven.apache.org/).
