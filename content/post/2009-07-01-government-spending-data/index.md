The United States CIO, Vivek Kundra, announced [USASpending](http://www.usaspending.gov/aboutthissite.php), which is an initiative by the US Govt to open up the US government's accounting and federal contract data.

It is based on [FedSpending](http://fedspending.org/) software, which has been sponsored by the Sunlight Foundation. I am very interested if the website is open source and have written to ask about it.
