[Russel Beattie](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/;jsessionid=82FCD2E91F1054E92D3D47D307259095) hypothesises about the next Jobs' job- the [iPhone](http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008182.html) . Personally, I feel that this may be a huge opportunity for small companies like Pixo( who made the OS for the iPod). Paul Mercer, the man behind Pixo has another startup called IVentor (not sure about the CamelCase!) . Their pitch is to make Java software for ... mobile phones. I wont be surprised if he is already working for an OS for the iPhone.
