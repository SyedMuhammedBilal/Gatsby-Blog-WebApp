interesting thought - from this video \[vimeo http://vimeo.com/16753929\]

The story that @fogus describes is quite interesting - how to introduce new programming language paradigms to the enterprise ? The problem that I have faced is usually in describing the value proposition - increased productivity is, sadly, not a convincing argument. I empathize with the client though because if a large services player naysays the productivity gains of, say, Ruby on Rails .... its difficult for a CIO to refuse.

But the interesting thing about this video is the way **_Type Aliases_** and **_Traits_** are able to able to do away without **_dependency injection_** \- which is a big timesink in Java.

And the other - **_duck typing_** avoids the need for **_interfaces_** ([http://www.kirit.com/Thread:/1720512](http://www.kirit.com/Thread:/1720512))**_._**

interesting.
