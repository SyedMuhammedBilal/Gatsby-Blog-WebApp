As the resident geek, I am often asked about which antivirus I use on my WinXP PC (for those times I need to update my Zune...sigh).

The products I use are not very well known among those who know about antivirus, but they have 3 features to love - they are **good**, they are lightweight, and they're free!

I usually rely on the results from [Av Comparatives](http://www.av-comparatives.org/) to decide on my antivirus. Currently, I use [Avira Antivirus](http://www.free-av.com/en/download/1/download_avira_antivir_personal__free_antivirus.html) (and love it) - but going by the recent [news](http://it.slashdot.org/it/08/10/23/1329226.shtml) of Avira not doing well on the Virus Bulletin 100 test, perhaps its time to change to ... maybe [Avast!](http://www.avast.com/eng/programs.html) .

 

P.S. I use [Comodo](http://www.comodo.com/) as an excellent firewall.
