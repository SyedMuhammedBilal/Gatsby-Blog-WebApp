[Here](http://www.pehub.com/45388/zappos-ceo-wanted-to-stay-independent-sequoia-wanted-liquidity%E2%80%94sources/)'s a very interesting inside look on the Zappos' [acquisition](http://blogs.zappos.com/ceoletter) by Amazon. What is interesting is that Sequoia entered at a very high valuation, but in exchange went for 3 - 3.5X liquidation preference.

That is huge - It would mean the investors would be snarling at the company's back to sell it. I would'nt be surprised to find out that Sequoia had indeed forced Zappos' hand.

It makes you think that indeed, valuations arent everything. I mean look at the scorched earth policy followed by microsoft by investing 100 mil into Facebook at crazy valuations. They made it too expensive to acquire.

I wonder if it would have been better if Zappos had gone in for a lower valuation at a reasaonable liquidation preference - throw a piece of meat for the wolves to chew on a while ...
