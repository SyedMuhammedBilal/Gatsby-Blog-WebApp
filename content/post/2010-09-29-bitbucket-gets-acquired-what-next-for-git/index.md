Do note that I have not said **_github_ , but git.**

**Because Github is the killer app for git - and now that bitbucket has unlimited public AND private repositories, that lead is soon melting away.**

**What I dont understand is that, why has'nt Github sponsored any development towards making git as a platform-neutral tool. \[This statement stands redacted after [news](https://github.com/blog/752-libgit2-a-git-linkable-library) of Github's efforts to create libgit2. However, I still believe that Github can do more - offer more training videos for free, etc.\]**

**Today, Git exists as a loose collection of scripts (perl and shell). There are three projects underway to make git, a bit more platform-agnostic. They are the [jgit](http://www.eclipse.org/jgit/) project(for Java), [Dulwich](https://launchpad.net/dulwich) (for Python) and [libgit2](http://repo.or.cz/w/libgit2.git) in C.**

**If I had to pick one, I would pick the Jgit project. I have used (and [written](http://sandeep.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/using-git-on-windows-without-any-of-the-cygwinmsysgit-nonsense/)) about using the Jgit commandline tool as a replacement for vanilla git. It works quite well, but it does not let you checkout commits, merge, branch, etc. It is fast enough that I dont particularly miss any performance differences.**

**There are way too many people who work on Windows - especially in the web development field. If they are at all to use git (and thereby open a whole new market for Github), these pieces of critical infrastructure must be in place. I dont understand why Github is not working towards this.**

**Secondly, I personally believe that Github needs to get a professionally created git tutorial (none better than [Peepcode's](http://peepcode.com/products/git) video) and host it for free on its website. Basic marketing 101 - but what I see is that they are offering to train you for a consulting fee.**

**What Github is competing against is not private gitloite repositories, but enterprise providers like Perforce, etc. who have so much [multimedia](http://www.perforce.com/perforce/media_library/index.html) content, that it isnt funny.**

It is hard for me to ask clients to get a Github account for their projects, because they cant figure out what it does.
