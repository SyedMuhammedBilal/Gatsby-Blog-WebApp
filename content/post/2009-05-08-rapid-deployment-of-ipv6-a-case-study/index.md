IPv6 is a must, must-have for India - the alternative is slow strangulation of access to the internet, deprivation of opportunities to create new Internet technologies and difficulty in providing access to the potential billions of people.

One of the favorite criticisms is how difficult it is to deploy V6. There is now a draft floating around in IETF, called 6rd, which plans to ease this, using a real life case study which went from proposal to deployment at 1.5 million users in a matter of **5 weeks**.

It is called [6RD](http://www.rfc-editor.org/internet-drafts/draft-despres-6rd-03.txt) - 6 'Rapid Deployment'

   Having ISPs to rapidly bring IPv6 to customers sites, in addition to
   IPv4 and without extra charge, is a way to break the existing vicious
   circle that has delayed IPv6 deployment: ISPs wait for customer
   demand before deploying IPv6; customers don't demand IPv6 as long as
   application vendors announce that their products work on existing
   infrastructures (that are IPv4 with NATs); application vendors focus
   their investments on NAT traversal compatibility as long as ISPs
   don't deploy IPv6.

   But most ISPs are not willing to add IPv6 to their current offer, at
   no charge, unless incurred investment and operational costs are
   extremely limited.  For this, ISPs that provide router CPEs to their
   customers have the most favorable conditions: they can upgrade their
   router CPEs to support IPv6 encapsulation and operate gateways
   between these infrastructures and the global IPv6 Internet to also do
   IPv6/v4 encapsulation, so that they can keep the routing plan of
   their IPv4 infrastructures.
I hope the government picks this up and charts out a roadmap for IPV6 deployment - it is absolutely [urgent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion#Exhaustion_date).
