TheÂ _[Centre for Technology Policy Research](http://ctpr.org/)_ in the U.K has made [recommendations](http://www.itjoblog.co.uk/2010/05/government-open-platform.html) about the use of technology to transform government as an open _platform._

A few interesting points:

- Cloud computing - similar to the U.S. government's [initiative](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/feds-launch-appsgov-cloud-computing-players-salivate/24331).
- Drop the idea of large databases and instead play on the [idea](http://www.smarthealthcare.com/cameron-clegg-conservatives-libdem-nhs-npfit-12may10) of using specialist cloud players (which means Microsoft's HealthVault and Google)

As someone else said - I do believe that the best thing would be to draft laws as a wiki, with full revision history !
