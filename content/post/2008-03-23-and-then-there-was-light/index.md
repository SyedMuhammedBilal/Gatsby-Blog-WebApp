This is so freaking cool that I couldnt stay away from posting it - it has the potential to change the way energy is consumed. I am more excited about this, because in a semi-developed country like India, there are countless miles of public areas that are unlighted because of want of energy. Moreover due to the weather conditions, I understand there is a high failure rate for existing street lighting. Forget street lighting, this has the potential to completely change the way home and office lighting works.

Its a plasma "lightbulb" and a Chiclet sized device can potentially put out as much light as a conventional streetlight but with **10 freaking X** the efficiency. It was [announced](http://hardware.slashdot.org/hardware/08/03/22/2049257.shtml)   by a lighting startup - Luxim and the [video demo](http://news.zdnet.com/2422-13568_22-192842.html), they put up is extremely cool.Now let us see if GE, Philips and other lighting makers throw obstacles in Luxim's way, because if they can get the manufacturing down correctly, we have the next GE on our hands!

In any case, I think they should simply go ahead and start selling the damn thing in India. They can "get around" the regulations needed to enter a market very easily and with such a large and upwardly mobile population, it will not be hard for them to be profitable. And not to mention the press that it will generate.
