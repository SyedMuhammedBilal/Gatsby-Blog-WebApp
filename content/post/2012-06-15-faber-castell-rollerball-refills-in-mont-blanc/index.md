so I am a big fan of Mont Blancs, because you know... they are shit expensive (yup, I'm shallow like that). However, Mont Blanc rollerball refills suck. Really, really suck. Within a few days they dry out and get scratchy and give a horrible experience. I spent a lot of money procuring expensive Mont Blanc refills with this problem.

Enter hacker.

So a popular mod has been to retrofit Mont Blanc refills on ona Pilot G2. This is with the assumption that Mont Blanc refills are superior. Instead, what I went about doing was the reverse - fit some other refills on Mont Blancs. So I find the Faber Castell 148713 rollerball refill. Its the same size as the MB refill, however has no threading where it can screw onto the pen body. Thankfully, it has plastic there. All you do is insert the refill in the Mont Blanc and twist it with some force and untwist it. Do this a couple of times and the pen will cut threads into the plastic.

The Faber Castell refill is simply one of the best refills I have used and I will now proceed to throw my \*unused\* MB refills away. The Faber Castells almost write like fountain pens - however there is always the cheap Pilot 0.7 rollerball refill if I want to go for a finer nib.
