Steve Brotman's [post](http://brotman.blogs.com/vcball/2004/12/take_the_fricti.html) on removing friction as a viable business model was an eye-opener. But is removing human beings from the workplace, the general idea behind removing friction. I believe not. See where Google is concerned and to a large extent Ebay (but not Amazon), is that there is almost no customer service. The biggest problem with customer service is ... service . To remove the human aspect from operations like this, lead to increased friction - in terms of goodwill.

Remove friction, insofar as customer experience is concerned - not at the cost of it.
