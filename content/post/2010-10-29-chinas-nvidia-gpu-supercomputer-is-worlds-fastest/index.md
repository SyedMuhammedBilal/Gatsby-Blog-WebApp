[This](http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/28/chinas-tianhe-1a-is-now-worlds-fastest-supercomputer-plans-to/) is simply incredible - China's Tianhe 1A is now the world's fastest supercomputer. Â Built using Xeons and nVidia Tesla systems, they churn out 2.5 petaflops.

This is government funded - what I cant understand is, how come the Indian govt is so [incompetent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Operating_System_Solutions).

Enough said.
