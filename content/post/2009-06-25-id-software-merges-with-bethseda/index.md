The god of game development - John Carmack - sells Id to Bethseda (or in other words, Doom meets Elder Scrolls).

Cant wait for a post-apocalyptic MMORPG - Bethseda is great with scripting great stories and architecting its games to make end-user contributions possible (for e.g. Elder Scrolls: Oblivion). Id is famous of course with wrenching out the last drop of juice out of graphics cards with its cutting edge graphics engines.Â  The last time, everyone upgraded their cards en-masse was when Doom3 came out : I would say nVidia is watching what direction this takes (what with everyone predicting the death of desktop gaming).

Id is famous also for open-sourcing its engines, roughly 5 years after they come out (for e.g. the IoQuake3 open-sourced engine). It will be interesting to see how this gets affected.

But ever since John Romero quit, Id didnt really have a story script to its games - like for example Valve with its superb Half Life franchise. The "Source" game engine was probably not as cutting edge as Doom3's, but what a game!

I hope they are able to deliver something really kickass and scary (I should probably plug for Penumbra: Dark Plague and oh-so-classic System Shock 2 here)
