The anser: I dont know.... But I needed to find out.

It all started when I was reading my copy of [Design and Evolution of C++](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDesign-Evolution-C-Bjarne-Stroustrup%2Fdp%2F0201543303&ei=zrh3SJf9EZHw7AP4w4m6Bw&usg=AFQjCNFkwQVmnC5sDaCaeCSBw_RuxTrXAA&sig2=JTuvzMGcBZvOI-bP3mFzyQ) by Stroustrup himself. It is a superlative work on the design process behind (arguably) the most popular language on the planet.

In one of the topics **\[13.11\]** I was confused by Stroustrup's statement:

> pointers to data members have proven a useful way of expressing the layout of a C++ class in an implementation **\[HÃ¼bel**, **1992\]**

Now that particular reference goes to a university research paper :

> _**An implementation of a persistent store for C++ -**_ **Aarhus Universistet**

With nothing else to go on, I searched on the university site (yes. I dont speak danish. No - I'm not being stupid). When I could find nothing, I tried very hard to track the author down.

Very, very hard.

No trace whatsoever - except on LinkedIn (where I dont have an _InMail_ account). Finally I found a posting in Danish on a .Net site. I registered myself (that is a long, long tale... and we shall not speak of it) and managed to send a message to Peter. Of course I had no hope of getting a reply.

And then today, Peter replies back to me and sends me a [link](ftp://ftp.daimi.au.dk/pub/stud/ludvig/aPersistentStoreForC++.ps.gz) to the Gzipped postscript of the manuscript. Cool!

Thanks Peter... I hope u dont mind me linking to a PDF version of the same \[[An implementation of a persistent store for C++\]](http://sandeep.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/ps.pdf)

P.S.: Why did'nt Google index this PostScript? does it have a problem with gzipped postscript?
