Your package management still sucks.... and languages like Clojure have set the bar that a modern language needs built in package and dependency management.

Lets not even talk about Ruby and Gems here.

Or lets - because I'm a Ruby man now. Plus Rails has no peer for a complete workflow (including asset management and schema versioning) - I've looked. And Python's flask is just a Sinatra wannabe.

I will now relearn ruby to do my daily small hack jobs in it.
