ahh.. seems I originated a new law. In response to this [article's](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/burnette/oracle-rebrands-java-breaks-eclipse/2012) comment which states:

> "Who fixes a bug by making something dependent on the dll/exe company name? Stupid...How are those outsourced indians working for you now Oracle and Sun!!!!"

I postulate thusly

> _**As an online discussion about PROGRAMMING grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving outsourcing or Indians approaches 1, if [Godwin's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law) has not already been satisfied**_

It is an honest attempt at reducing the **_reduction ad outsourcedum_ arguments that seem to be getting more popular.**
