Ever sinceI lost my (hacked to the filesystem and camera drivers) Sony Ericsson K750i, I have had to fall back on yesteryears workhorse - the Treo 650. Now that phone's interface looks like crap and so I had to take it upon me to inject some chutzpah into it.

First of all the default UI - what the treonauts (ha ha !!) call the Launcher. The best, coolest free launcher is ofcourse [iSpin Lite 1.8](http://www.freewarepalm.com/utilities/ispinlauncher.shtml) \- looks like a WinXP interface, but that can be configured. Then I needed something to roll back my mistakes - an installer. After searchin and searching, till there was gnashing of teeth, I found [Destaller Lite](http://mytreo.net/downloads/destaller-lite,554.html). This, in conjunction with (the most excellent) [Filez](http://mytreo.net/downloads/filez,3.html) lets me get on with my life. And of course, I needent even mention [Opera Mini](http://www.operamini.com/) without which **no phone** is complete (yes iPhone, I mean you). I am still on the lookout for a better call management software for the Treo.

Did I mention this is all until [Android](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(mobile_phone_platform)) comes sauntering along.
