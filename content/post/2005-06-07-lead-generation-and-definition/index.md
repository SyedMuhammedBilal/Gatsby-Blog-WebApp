Great [post](http://getgood.typepad.com/getgood_strategic_marketi/2005/03/leads_leads_lea_1.html) by [Susan Getgood](http://getgood.typepad.com) about lead generation and definition. I think this is the primary point of mud-slinging between sales and marketing. In addition to what Susan says, Brian Carroll writes brilliantly about a [universal lead definition](http://www.increasemysales.com/article.asp?ARTICLEID=159).
