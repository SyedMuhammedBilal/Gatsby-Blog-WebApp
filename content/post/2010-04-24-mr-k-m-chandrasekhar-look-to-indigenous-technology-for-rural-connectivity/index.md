There was this article in the [Hindu](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2010/03/29/stories/2010032951090200.htm), which talked about the Cabinet Secretary looking at investing 18,000 crore to provide broadband to rural areas. Justifiably, there is a doubt on what possible technology to use - 3G, Fiber optic, etc.

Eventually, fiber optic is the only scalable medium that can carry incredible amounts of data - voice, internet and even television.

However, for short term cost effectiveness, the best possible way is to use home grown low cost technology - like [AirJaldi](http://www.airjaldi.org/).

I have [written](http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/airjaldi-cost-and-terrain-effective-wireless-solution-for-rural-communities/) about AirJaldi in the [past](http://digitalsarkaar.wordpress.com/2009/11/09/are-we-ignoring-homegrown-tech-in-exchange-for-clever-marketing/) - and I believe that a low cost, free, open technology that is **already** being used to provide connectivity using the Dharamsala Community Wireless Mesh Network. They built 300$ Â [systems](http://drupal.airjaldi.com/node/74) that would otherwise cost 10,000$ and provide 45km 5mbps network link in mountain terrain.

This is already in place and field-tested in the harshest of conditions, why dont we go ahead and work with this.
